# ‚ú® IsekaiWar!

‚úß Freshman-year shoot 'em up, built in about 2 weeks ‚úß

‚ù± I made this project early in my freshman year at GamingCampus Lyon.                
The quality and architecture are quite terrible, as we had a tight deadline to build both the engine and the game.

It‚Äôs not reflective of my current skills, so please don‚Äôt judge too harshly :)
## üåå Features

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical :
- Custom engine architecture based on SFML
- Ready for deployment (binaries available)
- Support for resource packs
#### üïπ Gameplay :
- Simple menu with keybind settings
- Full gamepad support (menus included)
- Abilities and special bullets with effects
- Ultimate attacks with a "mana" system
- Multiple Power-Ups with different effects
- 5 different enemies with unique patterns
- 1 playable level (around 2 min of Gameplay)

‚Üª More features were planned, but we spent too much time on the engine.

## üßæ Lore

In IsekaiWar! the main protagonist Maxine (our teacher üòã) is 'teleported' by the main antagonist Truck-Kun üööüí• into a medieval fantasy world.

Maxine quickly discovers her destiny isn‚Äôt just to teach coding to dumb students.. But to wield it as a weapon üìê. Granted mysterious magical powers ‚ú® (and a questionable fireball spell she insists is "just science with flair" üî•), Maxine forms a pact with a grumpy, ancient phoenix known only as The Fenix üê¶‚Äç who refuses to spell its name the normal way.

Together, they must defend the realm of Amstrad from bizarre, neon-lit spaceships üöÄüõ∏ pouring through tears in the sky, üåå invaders from an alternate universe where medieval tech was replaced by angry AI ü§ñ and bad Wi-Fi üì∂üí¢. These ships, known as the C64 Armada ‚öîÔ∏è, seek to flatten the land, pixel by pixel , and replace it with brainrot and overpriced NFTs üí∏üìâ.

Now Maxine, armed with spells ‚ú®, sarcasm, and the stubborn spirit of a data driven developer üìù, must blast through wave after wave of alien spaceships to uncover the truth: why Truck-Kun chose her, and what horrifying connection the invaders have with her own world‚Äôs school system üè´‚ÅâÔ∏è
## üì• Installation

### Precompiled Binaries
If you want to the game right away, precompiled binaries are available in the release section.

[Download Latest Release](https://github.com/SHARKgamestudio/IsekaiWar)


### Building From Source
First, clone the repository using your favorite Git client:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SHARKgamestudio/IsekaiWar.git
```

This project uses a custom solution generator developed by my school teachers.        
To build the project, all you need to do is run the bash script at the following path:
```bash
./bin/make.bat
```

Finally, this project uses VCPKG in manifest mode to manage dependencies.        
If you are running Visual Studio, open your IDE and search for:        
```bash
Tools >> Command Line >> Developer PowerShell
```

Once opened, type the following command to install vcpkg for all versions of Visual Studio:
```bash
vcpkg integrate install
```

That‚Äôs it! You can now compile and run the project :)

‚ö†Ô∏è Side note: If you get errors about missing SFML DLLs, clean up the solution and build again.
